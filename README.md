The official Docker image for WireMock Standalone deployments.
It includes WireMock for Java under the hood, and fully compatible with its features.
You can learn more about WireMock standalone on the
[WireMock docs site]((http://wiremock.org/docs/standalone)).

## Quick Start

In a temporary directory, checkout the demo repository,
pull the Docker image,
and start the WireMock instance.

```shell
docker pull wiremock/wiremock:latest
git clone https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock-docker.git
docker run -it --rm \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $PWD/wiremock-docker/samples/hello/stubs:/home/wiremock \
  wiremock/wiremock:latest
```

You will get a CLI output like this one:

```shell
██     ██ ██ ██████  ███████ ███    ███  ██████   ██████ ██   ██
██     ██ ██ ██   ██ ██      ████  ████ ██    ██ ██      ██  ██
██  █  ██ ██ ██████  █████   ██ ████ ██ ██    ██ ██      █████
██ ███ ██ ██ ██   ██ ██      ██  ██  ██ ██    ██ ██      ██  ██
 ███ ███  ██ ██   ██ ███████ ██      ██  ██████   ██████ ██   ██

## Using WireMock in Docker

To start WireMock with the default settings:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 wiremock/wiremock
```

By default, the image exposes the 8080 port for HTTP.
To verify the WireMock state,
access [http://localhost:8080/__admin/health](http://localhost:8080/__admin/health) to display the health status and the information.
The `/__admin/health` endpoint is available for WireMock 3.1.0 or above.

## Configuring WireMock

You can configure WireMock using the following ways:

- Passing the CLI arguments
- Passing Environment variables
- Passing configuration files via volumes
- Building a custom image using `wiremock/wiremock` as a base image

### Passing the CLI arguments

To start with these WireMock arguments,
you can add them to the end of the command line.
For example, to enable HTTPs: `--https-port 8443 --verbose`

```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 8443:8443 wiremock/wiremock --https-port 8443 --verbose
```

### Using environment variables

The following environment variables are supported by the image:

- `uid` : the container executor uid, useful to avoid file creation owned by root
- `JAVA_OPTS` : for passing any custom options to Java e.g. `-Xmx128m`
- `WIREMOCK_OPTIONS`: CLI options to be passed to WireMock (starting from `3.2.0-2`).

Example for passing the CLI options:

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
  -e WIREMOCK_OPTIONS='--https-port 8443 --verbose' \
  -p 8443:8443 \
  --name wiremock \
  wiremock/wiremock:latest
```

### Passing configuration files as volumes

Inside the container, the WireMock uses `/home/wiremock` as the root from which it reads the `mappings` and `__files` directories.
This means you can mount a directory containing these from your host machine into Docker and WireMock will load the stub mappings.

To mount the current directory use `-v $PWD:/home/wiremock` e.g.:

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --name wiremock \
  -v $PWD:/home/wiremock \
  wiremock/wiremock:{{ site.wiremock_version }}
```

## Building your own image

Inside the container, the WireMock uses `/home/wiremock` as the root from which it reads the `mappings` and `__files` directories.
This means you can copy your configuration from your host machine into Docker and WireMock will load the stub mappings.

WireMock utilizes a custom entrypoint script that passes all provided arguments as WireMock startup parameters. To modify the WireMock launch parameters it is recommended to override the entrypoint in your custom Docker image. 

```Dockerfile
# Sample Dockerfile
FROM wiremock/wiremock:latest
COPY wiremock /home/wiremock
ENTRYPOINT ["/docker-entrypoint.sh", "--global-response-templating", "--disable-gzip", "--verbose"]
```

## Using WireMock extensions

You can use any [WireMock extension](https://wiremock.org/docs/extensions)
with the Docker image.
They can be added via CLI and volumes,
but for most of the use-cases it is recommended to build a custom image by extending the
official one.

### Using extensions in CLI

```sh
# prepare extension folder
mkdir wiremock-docker/samples/random/extensions
# download extension
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/opentable/wiremock-body-transformer/1.1.3/wiremock-body-transformer-1.1.3.jar \
  -O wiremock-docker/samples/random/extensions/wiremock-body-transformer-1.1.3.jar
# run a container using extension 
docker run -it --rm \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $PWD/wiremock-docker/samples/random/stubs:/home/wiremock \
  -v $PWD/wiremock-docker/samples/random/extensions:/var/wiremock/extensions \
  wiremock/wiremock \
    --extensions com.opentable.extension.BodyTransformer
```

### Using extensions in the Dockerfile

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock-docker.git
docker build -t wiremock-random wiremock-docker/samples/random
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 wiremock-random
```

> Access [http://localhost:8080/random](http://localhost:8080/random) to show random number

## Advanced use-cases

### Using HTTPs

For HTTPs, the `8443` port is exposed by default.
To run with HTTPs, run the following command:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 8443:8443 wiremock/wiremock --https-port 8443 --verbose
```

To check the HTTPs on the default exposed port,
use [https://localhost:8443/__admin](https://localhost:8443/__admin) to check HTTPs working.

### Using the Record Mode

In Record mode, when binding host folders (e.g. $PWD/test) with the container volume (/home/wiremock), the created files will be owned by root, which is, in most cases, undesired.
To avoid this, you can use the `uid` docker environment variable to also bind host uid with the container executor uid.

```sh
docker run -d --name wiremock-container \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $PWD/test:/home/wiremock \
  -e uid=$(id -u) \
  wiremock/wiremock \
    --proxy-all="http://registry.hub.docker.com" \
    --record-mappings --verbose
curl http://localhost:8080
docker rm -f wiremock-container
```

> Check the created file owner with `ls -alR test`

However, the example above is a facility.
The good practice is to create yourself the binded folder with correct permissions and to use the *-u* docker argument.

```sh
mkdir test
docker run -d --name wiremock-container \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $PWD/test:/home/wiremock \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  wiremock/wiremock \
    --proxy-all="http://registry.hub.docker.com" \
    --record-mappings --verbose
curl http://localhost:8080
docker rm -f wiremock-container
```

> Check the created file owner with `ls -alR test`

### Docker Compose

Configuration in compose file is similar to Dockerfile definition

```yaml
# Sample compose file
version: "3"
services:
  wiremock:
    image: "wiremock/wiremock:latest"
    container_name: my_wiremock
    entrypoint: ["/docker-entrypoint.sh", "--global-response-templating", "--disable-gzip", "--verbose"]
```

You can also mount your local `__files` and `mappings` files into the container e.g:

```yaml
# Sample compose file
version: "3"
services:
  wiremock:
    image: "wiremock/wiremock:latest"
    container_name: my_wiremock
    volumes:
      - ./__files:/home/wiremock/__files
      - ./mappings:/home/wiremock/mappings
    entrypoint: ["/docker-entrypoint.sh", "--global-response-templating", "--disable-gzip", "--verbose"]
```
